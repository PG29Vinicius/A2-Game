# SuperMadFlyingCreatures

A physics-based 2D game inspired in Angry Birds, made with Planck.

## Tools

- Planck - physics engine to simulate real physics with collisions and gravity.
[Planck.js] (https://piqnt.com/planck.js/)
- Level Editor - made with Canvas to create levels and save their information in JSON files, so the game can read and load those levels.
- Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## How it works

Install the dependencies on the CMD;
```
npm install

```

Start the server on the CMD;
```
npm run dev

```

Access the editor and the game through:
`http://localhost:3000/game.html`
`http://localhost:3000/editor.html`

Create and save levels in the editor, refresh the game page and load them through the Level Selector dropdown on the upper section of the webpage.

## How to play

Click on the red circle and drag it on the opposite direction you want to shoot it;
Release the click to launch the red circle;
Try to collect all the coins and destroy all green circle enemies to complete the level;
Avoid hitting the red squares to not get destroyed.
